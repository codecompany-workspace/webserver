# Webserver

This website will be our own website. It will function as the front to our costumers, and possibly costumers, and it will function as a portal for them to contact us. It will also work as a 'showroom' where we will display working examples of sites and features, we will be able to offer.

The website will be build up of modules. Both the design and the script of the site. We will use the same modules to build up costumers sites. In that way, we do only need to write the code once, and we only need to know, fix and update on code. Only the design and mix of modules will differ from costumer to costumer.

# Use of git:
1. Always pull First
2. Then stage/add your files and changes to your commit
3. Commit your changes to the branch. Always write a message and good explanation of your work/changes
4. Then push your changes to the branch, and the GitHub server
